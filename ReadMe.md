As part of my group project in year 3 I created this Android App, a clone of the Uber App.

The main code is in: \2018_GroupProject\app\src\main\java\com\group12\pickup
This app requires login or to set up an account.
Once past the login screen you get a google maps screen with your current location and options.
You can then request a car which tracks a route to your destination and processes payment.
You can also view past trips and leave feedback.


The car tracking was simulated by using an arduino, the code for this can be found in the ArduinoConnection folder.
